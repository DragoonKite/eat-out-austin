## General info
This list of restaurants aids diners looking for something beyond the Top-10 of every city on every site.  Each eatery is chosen by someone who works in the restaurant industry whether they be a chef, a server or bartender.  These are the places that restaurant workers go to relax, eat and enjoy themselves when they leave their full-time job in a restaurant.

Who is qualified to make these lists?  Our team of professionals that actually work in the restaurant industry are here to guide your next dining adventure!
