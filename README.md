## General info
This list of restaurants aids diners looking for something beyond the Top-10 of every city on every site.  Each eatery is chosen by someone who works in the restaurant industry whether they be a chef, a server or bartender.  These are the places that restaurant workers go to relax, eat and enjoy themselves when they leave their full-time job in a restaurant.

Every site focused on dining out has a list of places to try in any city, but too often, the lists are all the same.  Where does a local dine?  What makes a guest return again and again?  Who is qualified to make these lists?  Our team of professionals that actually work in the restaurant industry are here to guide your next dining adventure!
